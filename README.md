# ML-Project-Walkthrough
In this repository, I will give details guidance on how to carry out 3 different Machine Learning Projects. 
The initiative is courtesy of <b>AI+OSOGBO </b> <br>
The steps to follow for each project is what I call the MLPLC Machine Learning Process Life Cycle which include 
1. **Data Cleaning and Formatting**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
3. **Feature Engineering and Selection**
4. **Establish a baseline**
5. **Evaluate the best model on the test set**
I  hope to explain basic and advanced techniques and terms in ML 
and clear some few misconceptions. 

The class will run on YouTube and it starts on Monday 1st of June, 2020
